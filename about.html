				<h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>
				<p><div style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I'm not new to tech, but I am new to taking it seriously as a passion. </div></p>
				<p><div style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">I was into computers since I was a kid, but like many folks, I never thought I had what it took for a career in that field. Glad I was wrong! As it turned out, the technical and data aspects of my nonprofit jobs were always what I loved the most. Changing careers in midlife to pursue programming and cyber security has made me think hard about how I'm really interested in spending my days. </div></p>
				<p><div style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">It's important to me to keep an ethical, community-first focus, to any tech training I do, and the work it invites. Whether the way we relate to tech is truly at a turning point, or just feels like one, the vast knowledge that's currently available means we each have a powerful impact on what the future could be.</div></p>
